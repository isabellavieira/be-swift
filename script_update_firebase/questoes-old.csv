In Swift, the index of an array’s first element is 0, not 1. At first, as the number 9 was in the fifth position, its index was 4. However, on the third line, we removed the element whose index was 3 (which means we removed the item located in the forth position: the number 7). That way, our new array list is [1,3,5,9,11].
